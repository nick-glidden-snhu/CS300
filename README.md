### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I was solving in this project, was finding efficient ways to accomplish tasks. I found that in all the assignments/projects within this course, there were very easy ways to accomplosh the final result. However, that was not the purpose of this class, rather, the purpose was to gain experience in finding the best way to deliver the same final result. In this project, we load a large amount of auction bids, and write efficent functions to load, display, search, insert, and delete bids.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
For me, I approached the problem by one, understanding each of the data strucutres deeply. This wasn't the easiest thing to do, but reuired for the second step. The second step, was to use this information to make an informed decision on which data stucture suited the problem the most. I had to understand what each data structures pro's and con's were, and how they were relevant in this scenario. What did the input look like? What does the output need to look like? Does the data need to be sorted, searched, or quickly acessed? How much information is there? All of these questions are how I approached the incredibly important question: which data structure do I use?

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
For me, I used the rubber duck method of debugging, as well as the many built-in debug tools found in VS Code. The first, the rubber duck method, is a way of explainign your code aloud, to a "rubber ducky toy" on yopur desk. This may seem silly, but by explaining code in the simplest way possible, often reveals issues that are hard to find within your mind. When this didn't work out, I used debugging tools like breakpoints, "cout <<" statements at various milestones in my code, and the error list to gain more information on the error. Where is this happening? What is the formal error code retruned? How is the program flowing during runtime?

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
For me, I defintely found that doing things the best way, isn't always the easiest way. I became aware that I need to practice deciding on, implementing, and developing data structures much more during this semester. I have found an increidble tool called Leetcode, and have set some goals for myself in 2023, to really gain expertise in this subject area. I found that when developing a program, storage, memory, and time requirments are incredibly important!

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I think that I defintely became a much better code commenter compared from the start of this project, to the end. I write shorter, more to the point comments, that I feel better align with what most developers do in their own work. Aditionally, I also found naming variables is an art, and by being as clear as possible with the naming of your variables, the better. Truly, well-named variables can make or the readability of your code! Unreadable code is also difficult to maintain, and adaptable!
